# This project is dead!

With the Firefox 57, _It's All Text!_ has stopped working and fixing it would require throwing everything out and starting again from scratch.

Instead, I would suggest using one of these projects:

- [emacs chrome](https://github.com/stsquad/emacs_chrome/) (which is being [ported to Firefox](https://github.com/stsquad/emacs_chrome/pull/130))
- [GhostText](https://github.com/GhostText/GhostText)

Thank you everyone for your suggestions, appreciation, and help!
